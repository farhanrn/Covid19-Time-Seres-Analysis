# COVID-19 Time Series Analysis

This project provides an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 time series data, focusing on identifying trends, visualizing case progression, and analyzing the impact of COVID-19 across various regions and timeframes. The analysis was conducted using Python and various data science libraries.

## Project Overview

This notebook aims to analyze the spread and trends of COVID-19 cases over time. Using time series data, it visualizes infection rates, identifies patterns, and generates insights about the impact of COVID-19 globally. The project leverages data visualization and statistical analysis to draw meaningful conclusions from the data.

## Features

- Time series analysis of COVID-19 cases
- Visualization of trends in cases, recoveries, and deaths
- Regional analysis of COVID-19 impact
- Predictive modeling for future trends (if applicable)

## Installation

To run this notebook, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Optional libraries:

- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab for running `.ipynb` files.
- Any additional packages specific to this notebook.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the notebook `Covid 19 Time Series Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

### Data

This project utilizes COVID-19 time series data, which includes records of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across various countries and timeframes. The data source is publicly available and may be periodically updated to reflect new cases.

> **Note:** Make sure to update the dataset path if using a different dataset or directory.

## Results

The analysis provides several key insights:

- Daily trends in confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths.
- Regional hotspots and comparisons of COVID-19 impact.
- Predictive trends for understanding potential future impacts (if applicable).
